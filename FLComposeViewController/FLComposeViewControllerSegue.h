/**
 A `FLComposeViewControllerSegue` is responsible for performing the transition between view controllers that are children of a FLComposeViewController object. This segue can only be used if both the source and destination view controllers are children of the same compose view controller object.

 Compose view controller segues are rarely instantiated directly. In the most common case, the compose view controller segue can be used as a custom segue between two children of a compose view controller object in a storyboard.
